  description: "Thought lost in the late 20th Century, the Revelation recently appeared
    just outside the Earth's Thermosphere.  A crew out of time, Pilot Edwin Swigert
    and his trusty allies will stop at nothing to find a way back home. Retrofitted
    with enhanced light-swagger engines and modularized Polaric\u2122  hull plating,
    Revelation is probably a match for something out there. "
