  description: "(Loo-Ma_Lek)  The Roswell incident is the 1947 crash of a United
    States Army Air Forces balloon at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, and the subsequent
    conspiracy theories claiming that the crash involved a flying saucer. \u201CWe
    neither confirm nor deny these claims, but here\u2019s a HUMAN made ship, with
    HUMAN things in it.\u201D - Admiral Dean Crantz III of the Sol Initiative"
