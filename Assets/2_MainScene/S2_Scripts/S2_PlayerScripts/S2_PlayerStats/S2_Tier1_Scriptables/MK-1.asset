  description: The MK-1 Space Ship was thought lost on its mission to Ethos, forced
    through a rift by his ex-partner, Rick Shemaines; he now fights for his freedom.
    Larry Mange, a disgraced Sol Initiative operative, spent years in the Virgo Cluster;
    he now seeks revenge for the two decades spent in his old rust bucket.
